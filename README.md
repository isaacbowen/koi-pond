I wanted to know if the following behavioral logic chunks, combined, would result in natural schooling:

1. your field of vision is limited
2. steer into you-sized gaps
3. respect personal space
4. go with the flow

turns out chatgpt is REALLY GOOD at translating this kind of thing into code. so, so, so much fun.

there's more to explore here. I think it'd work to have clusters of nodes develop _their own_ behavioral intelligence, which would then serve as that step-4-gentle-guidance factor. this ends up becoming recursive (as all life is). I think I may yet explore that direction (as if I wasn't ALWAYS exploring organic recursion, lol), but for the moment, the gentle circular current will do as a simplified proxy. :)

love y'all
